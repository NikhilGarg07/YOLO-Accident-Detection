# YOLO-Accident-Detection
 The model is to detect the accident at the site and will identify the objects in terms of vehicle class whether the object is car, bus, van etc. and also detect the accident that is whether the accident happened or not. Proper labeling will be there which make sure to give whole information from the site we examine.This model will also run on videos and in real time which will detect the accident in a fraction of seconds. Mainly our focus is on the far moving objects which must be captured by cctv cams as they are located on some height and it becomes some challenging task to detect objects from far images captured and classify them accordingly. We train our model in such a way that it will do the task of accident detection from far sites and cctv footages.
